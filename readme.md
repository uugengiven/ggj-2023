Plant modifying/editing

Plants have some set of stats:
Root depth
Water requirements
Nutrient requirements
Fruit
Change in dirt
Leaf Size

Plants have some set of calculated stats
Growth Speed
Heartiness

Planting base plants gives a slight randomization on the base
Splicing two plants together will alter stats toward the two plants
Depending on the splice, some stats move toward one plant, some move toward the other, with some randomization of each stat

Dirt has some set of stats:
Acidity
Nutrients
Moisture

Weather?
Events?
Disease?
Get new plots of land (can have limited numbers early)?
Run tests to find out about dirt at any given time?
Changes in dirt are different per time period?

God dammit, I made blaseball
